I had the opportunity to work on a challenging project called rateeat.app, where we aimed to develop a food rating system. The objective was to create a user-friendly platform that allowed individuals to rate and review restaurants and their dishes.

One of the major hurdles we encountered was driving user adoption and expanding the platform's market reach. Similar to the approach embraced by Palantir, we adopted an iterative methodology. We constantly incorporated user feedback and responded to market demands, continuously updating and enhancing the product.

The impact and outcome of this project were truly significant. We successfully onboarded over 3,000 users and partnered with more than 200 restaurants. The data collected through the platform has now become invaluable for companies and individuals in making informed decisions.

I got a chance to work on this tough project called rateeat.app, where we were trying to make a food rating system. The goal was to make a platform that's easy for people to use and lets them rate and review restaurants and their food.

We ran into some big issues along the way, like getting people to actually use the platform and getting it to reach more people. To fix this, we used a method called iterative and agile development. We listened to what users had to say and changed things based on what the market wanted. We made lots of updates and improvements to the product.

The impact and outcome of this project were truly significant. We successfully onboarded over 3,000 users and partnered with more than 200 restaurants. The data collected through the platform has now become invaluable for companies and individuals in making informed decisions.

This experience made me better at coding because it showed me how important it is to write good, clean code. As the project got bigger, it became really important to have a codebase that was modular and well-structured. That way, we could add new features in the future without too much trouble. The agile approach let us adapt quickly and give our users what they wanted.
